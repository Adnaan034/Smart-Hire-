# 🚀 Smart Hire Project

### 🔹 Description
Smart Hire is an intelligent recruitment system designed to analyze candidate profiles, skills, and experience to recommend suitable job roles and predict potential career paths. This project leverages machine learning and data visualization to streamline hiring, reduce manual screening, and provide actionable insights for HR teams and organizations.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow & Components
1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Checked for missing values and data inconsistencies

🔍 Analyzed key features like Job Title, Experience Required, Skills, Role Category, and Location

📊 Visualized data distributions to understand trends, frequency of job roles, and skill patterns

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

🧹 Handled missing values by imputation or removal

✏️ Standardized text fields for uniformity in skills and job roles

🔢 Encoded categorical variables for ML model compatibility

⚖️ Balanced the dataset using techniques like SMOTE or resampling

### 3️⃣ Visualizations

📉 Before Balancing: Showed original distribution of target classes to highlight data imbalance

📈 After Balancing: Showed how dataset became balanced post preprocessing

📊 Plotted bar charts, count plots, and distribution plots for key features like skills, roles, and experience

💡 Provided clear insights for HR decisions and recruitment strategy
